# Building CarbonData

## Prerequisites
* Unix-like environment (Linux, Mac OS X)
* Git
* [Apache Maven (Recommend version 3.3 or later)](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [Oracle Java 7 or 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Apache Thrift 0.9.3](https://thrift.apache.org/download)

## Build release version
Note:Need install Apache Thrift
```
mvn clean -DskipTests -Pbuild-with-format install
```

## Build dev version(snapshot version,clone from github)
Note:Already uploaded format.jar to snapshot repo for facilitating dev users,
so the compilation command works without "-Pbuild-with-format"

Build without test,by default carbondata takes Spark 1.5.2 to build the project
```
mvn -DskipTests clean package
```

Build with different supported versions of Spark.
```
mvn -DskipTests -Pspark-1.5 -Dspark.version=1.5.0 clean package
mvn -DskipTests -Pspark-1.5 -Dspark.version=1.5.1 clean package
mvn -DskipTests -Pspark-1.5 -Dspark.version=1.5.2 clean package
 
mvn -DskipTests -Pspark-1.6 -Dspark.version=1.6.0 clean package
mvn -DskipTests -Pspark-1.6 -Dspark.version=1.6.1 clean package
mvn -DskipTests -Pspark-1.6 -Dspark.version=1.6.2 clean package
```

Build with test
```
mvn clean package
```
