# Index Developer Guide

### Introduction
DataMap is a data structure that can be used to accelerate certain query of the table. Different DataMap can be implemented by developers. 
Currently, there are two types of DataMap supported:
1. IndexDataMap: DataMap that leverages index to accelerate filter query. Lucene DataMap and BloomFiler DataMap belong to this type of DataMaps.
2. MVDataMap: DataMap that leverages Materialized View to accelerate olap style query, like SPJG query (select, predicate, join, groupby). Preaggregate, timeseries and mv DataMap belong to this type of DataMaps.

### Index Provider
When user issues `CREATE INDEX index_name ON TABLE main AS 'provider'`, the corresponding DataMapProvider implementation will be created and initialized. 
Currently, the provider string can be:
1. class name IndexDataMapFactory implementation: Developer can implement new type of IndexDataMap by extending IndexDataMapFactory

When user issues `DROP INDEX index_name ON TABLE main`, the corresponding DataMapProvider interface will be called.
