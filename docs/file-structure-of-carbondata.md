# CarbonData File Structure

CarbonData files contain groups of data called blocklets, along with all required information like schema, offsets and indices etc, in a file header and footer, co-located in HDFS.

The file footer can be read once to build the indices in memory, which can be utilized for optimizing the scans and processing for all subsequent queries.

### Understanding CarbonData File Structure
* Block : It would be as same as HDFS block, CarbonData creates one file for each data block, user can specify TABLE_BLOCKSIZE during creation table. Each file contains File Header, Blocklets and File Footer.

* File Header : It contains CarbonData file version number, list of column schema and schema updation timestamp.
* File Footer : it contains Number of rows, segmentinfo ,all blockletsâ€™ info and index, you can find the detail from the below diagram.
* Blocklet : Rows are grouped to form a blocklet, the size of the blocklet is configurable and default size is 64MB, Blocklet contains Column Page groups for each column.
* Column Page Group : Data of one column and it is further divided to pages, it is guaranteed to be contiguous in file.
* Page : It has the data of one column and the number of row is fixed to 32000 size.

### Each page contains three types of data
* Data Page: Contains the encoded data of a column of columns.
* Row ID Page (optional): Contains the row ID mappings used when the data page is stored as an inverted index.
* RLE Page (optional): Contains additional metadata used when the data page is RLE coded.
