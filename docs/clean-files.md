## CLEAN FILES

Clean files command is used to remove the Compacted, Marked For Delete ,In Progress which are stale and partial(Segments which are missing from the table status file but their data is present)
 segments from the store.

 Clean Files Command
   ```
   CLEAN FILES FOR TABLE TABLE_NAME
   ```
The above clean files command will clean Marked For Delete and Compacted segments depending on ```max.query.execution.time``` (default 1 hr) and ``` carbon.trash.retention.days``` (default 7 days). It will also delete the timestamp subdirectories from the trash folder after expiration day(default 7 day, can be configured)

**NOTE**:
  * Clean files operation not supported on non transactional tables.
  * Clean files operation not supported on tables with concurrent insert overwrite operation.

### TRASH FOLDER

  Carbondata supports a Trash Folder which is used as a redundant folder where all stale(segments whose entry is not in tablestatus file) carbondata segments are moved to during clean files operation.
  This trash folder is mantained inside the table path and is a hidden folder(.Trash). The segments that are moved to the trash folder are mantained under a timestamp 
  subfolder(each clean files operation is represented by a timestamp). This helps the user to list down segments in the trash folder by timestamp.  By default all the timestamp sub-directory have an expiration
  time of 7 days(since the timestamp it was created) and it can be configured by the user using the following carbon property. The supported values are between 0 and 365(both included.)
   ```
   carbon.trash.retention.days = "Number of days"
   ``` 
  Once the timestamp subdirectory is expired as per the configured expiration day value, that subdirectory is deleted from the trash folder in the subsequent clean files command.

**NOTE**:
  * In trash folder, the retention time is "carbon.trash.retention.days"
  * Outside trash folder(Segment Directories in table path), the retention time is Max("carbon.trash.retention.days", "max.query.execution.time")
### FORCE OPTION
The force option with clean files command deletes all the files and folders from the trash folder and delete the Marked for Delete and Compacted segments immediately. Since Clean Files operation with force option will delete data that can never be recovered, the force option by default is disabled. Clean files with force option is only allowed when the carbon property ```carbon.clean.file.force.allowed``` is set to true. The default value of this property is false.
                                                                                                                                                                       


  ```
  CLEAN FILES FOR TABLE TABLE_NAME options('force'='true')
  ```

### STALE_INPROGRESS OPTION
The stale_inprogress option deletes the stale Insert In Progress segments after the expiration of the property    ```carbon.trash.retention.days``` 

  ```
  CLEAN FILES FOR TABLE TABLE_NAME options('stale_inprogress'='true')
  ```

The stale_inprogress option with force option will delete Marked for delete, Compacted and stale Insert In progress immediately. It will also empty  the trash folder immediately.

  ```
  CLEAN FILES FOR TABLE TABLE_NAME options('stale_inprogress'='true', 'force'='true')
  ```
