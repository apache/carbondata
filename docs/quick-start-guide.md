# Quick Start
This tutorial provides a quick introduction to using CarbonData.

##  Prerequisites
* [Installation and building CarbonData](https://github.com/apache/incubator-carbondata/blob/master/build).
* Create a sample.csv file using the following commands. The CSV file is required for loading data into CarbonData.

  ```
  cd carbondata
  cat > sample.csv << EOF
  id,name,city,age
  1,david,shenzhen,31
  2,eason,shenzhen,27
  3,jarry,wuhan,35
  EOF
  ```

## Interactive Analysis with Spark Shell Version 2.1

Apache Spark Shell provides a simple way to learn the API, as well as a powerful tool to analyze data interactively. Please visit [Apache Spark Documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) for more details on Spark shell.

#### Basics

Start Spark shell by running the following command in the Spark directory:

```
./bin/spark-shell --jars <carbondata assembly jar path>
```
**NOTE**: Assembly jar will be available after [building CarbonData](https://github.com/apache/incubator-carbondata/blob/master/build/README.md) and can be copied from `./assembly/target/scala-2.1x/carbondata_xxx.jar`

In this shell, SparkSession is readily available as `spark` and Spark context is readily available as `sc`.

In order to create a CarbonSession we will have to configure it explicitly in the following manner :

* Import the following :

```
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
import org.apache.spark.sql.CarbonSession._
```

* Create a CarbonSession :

```
val carbon = SparkSession.builder().config(sc.getConf).getOrCreateCarbonSession("<hdfs store path>")
```
**NOTE**: By default metastore location is pointed to `../carbon.metastore`, user can provide own metastore location to CarbonSession like `SparkSession.builder().config(sc.getConf).getOrCreateCarbonSession("<hdfs store path>", "<local metastore path>")`

#### Executing Queries

###### Creating a Table

```
scala>carbon.sql("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table(id string, name string, city string, age Int) STORED BY 'carbondata'")
```

###### Loading Data to a Table

```
scala>carbon.sql("LOAD DATA INPATH 'sample.csv file path' INTO TABLE test_table")
```
**NOTE**: Please provide the real file path of `sample.csv` for the above script.

###### Query Data from a Table

```
scala>carbon.sql("SELECT * FROM test_table").show()

scala>carbon.sql("SELECT city, avg(age), sum(age) FROM test_table GROUP BY city").show()
```

## Interactive Analysis with Spark Shell Version 1.6

#### Basics

Start Spark shell by running the following command in the Spark directory:

```
./bin/spark-shell --jars <carbondata assembly jar path>
```
**NOTE**: Assembly jar will be available after [building CarbonData](https://github.com/apache/incubator-carbondata/blob/master/build/README.md) and can be copied from `./assembly/target/scala-2.1x/carbondata_xxx.jar`

**NOTE**: In this shell, SparkContext is readily available as `sc`.

* In order to execute the Queries we need to import CarbonContext:

```
import org.apache.spark.sql.CarbonContext
```

* Create an instance of CarbonContext in the following manner :

```
val cc = new CarbonContext(sc, "<hdfs store path>")
```
**NOTE**: If running on local machine without hdfs, configure the local machine's store path instead of hdfs store path

#### Executing Queries

###### Creating a Table

```
scala>cc.sql("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id string, name string, city string, age Int) STORED BY 'carbondata'")
```
To see the table created :

```
scala>cc.sql("SHOW TABLES").show()
```

###### Loading Data to a Table

```
scala>cc.sql("LOAD DATA INPATH 'sample.csv file path' INTO TABLE test_table")
```
**NOTE**: Please provide the real file path of `sample.csv` for the above script.

###### Query Data from a Table

```
scala>cc.sql("SELECT * FROM test_table").show()
scala>cc.sql("SELECT city, avg(age), sum(age) FROM test_table GROUP BY city").show()
```
