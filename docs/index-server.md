# Distributed Index Server

## Background

Carbon currently prunes and caches all block/blocklet index information into the driver for
normal table, for Bloom/Lucene indexes the JDBC driver will launch a job to prune and cache in executors.

This causes the driver to become a bottleneck in the following ways:
1. If the cache size becomes huge(70-80% of the driver memory) then there can be excessive GC in
the driver which can slow down the query and the driver may even go OutOfMemory.
2. LRU has to evict a lot of elements from the cache to accommodate the new objects which would
in turn slow down the queries.
3. For bloom there is no guarantee that the next query goes to the same executor to reuse the cache
and hence cache could be duplicated in multiple executors.
4. Multiple JDBC drivers need to maintain their own copy of the cache.

Distributed Index Cache Server aims to solve the above mentioned problems.

## Distribution
When enabled, any query on a carbon table will be routed to the index server service in form of
a request. The request will consist of the table name, segments, filter expression and other
information used for pruning.

In IndexServer service a pruning RDD is fired which will take care of the pruning for that
request. This RDD will be creating tasks based on the number of segments that are applicable for 
pruning. It can happen that the user has specified segments to access for that table, so only the
specified segments would be applicable for pruning. Refer: [query-data-with-specified-segments](./segment-management-on-carbondata.md#query-data-with-specified-segments).
IndexServer driver would have 2 important tasks, distributing the segments equally among the
available executors and keeping track of the executor where the segment is cached.

To achieve this 2 separate mappings would be maintained as follows.
1. segment to executor location:
This mapping will be maintained for each table and will enable the index server to track the 
cache location for each segment.

2. Cache size held by each executor: 
This mapping will be used to distribute the segments equally(on the basis of size) among the executors.
  
Once a request is received each segment would be iterated over and
checked against tableToExecutorMapping to find if a executor is already
assigned. If a mapping already exists then it means that most
probably(if not evicted by LRU) the segment is already cached in that
executor and the task for that segment has to be fired on this executor.

If mapping is not found then first check executorToCacheMapping against
the available executor list to find if any unassigned executor is
present and use that executor for the current segment. If all the
executors are assigned with some segment then find the least loaded
executor on the basis of size.

Initially the segment index size would be used to distribute the
segments fairly among the executor because the actual cache size would
be known to the driver only when the segments are cached and appropriate
information is returned to the driver.

**NOTE:** In case of legacy segment(version: 1.1) the index size is not available
therefore all the legacy segments would be processed in a round robin
fashion.

After the job is completed the tasks would return the cache size held by
each executor which would be updated to the executorToCacheMapping and
the pruned blocklets which would be further used for result fetching.

**Note:** Multiple JDBC drivers can connect to the index server to use the cache.

## Enabling Size based distribution for Legacy stores
The default round robin based distribution causes unequal distribution of cache among the executors, which can cause any one of the executors to be bloated with too much cache resulting in performance degrade.
This problem can be solved by running the `upgrade_segment` command which will fill the data size values for each segment in the tablestatus file. Any cache loaded after this can use the traditional size based distribution.

#### Example
```
alter table table1 compact 'upgrade_segment';
```

## Reallocation of executor
In case executor(s) become dead/unavailable then the segments that were
earlier being handled by those would be reassigned to some other
executor using the distribution logic.

**Note:** Cache loading would be done again in the new executor for the
current query.

## MetaCache DDL
The show metacache DDL has a new column called cache location will indicate whether the cache is
from executor or driver. To drop cache the user has to enable/disable the index server using the
dynamic configuration to clear the cache of the desired location.

Refer: [MetaCacheDDL](./ddl-of-carbondata.md#cache)

## Fallback
In case of any failure the index server would fallback to embedded mode
which means that the JDBCServer would take care of distributed pruning.
A similar job would be fired by the JDBCServer which would take care of
pruning using its own executors. If for any reason the embedded mode
also fails to prune the indexes then the job would be passed on to
driver.

**NOTE:** In case of embedded mode a job would be fired after pruning to clear the
cache as data cached in JDBCServer executors would be of no use.

## Writing splits to a file
If the response is too huge then it is better to write the splits to a file so that the driver can
read this file and create the splits. This can be controlled using the property 'carbon.index.server
.inmemory.serialization.threshold.inKB'. By default, the minimum value for this property is 0,
meaning that no matter how small the splits are they would be written to the file. Maximum is
102400KB which will mean if the size of the splits for a executor cross this value then they would
be written to file.

The user can set the location for these files by using 'carbon.indexserver.temp.path'. By default
the files are written in the path /tmp/indexservertmp.

## Prepriming
As each query is responsible for caching the pruned indexes, thus a lot of execution time is wasted in reading the 
files and caching the datmaps for the first query.
To avoid this problem we have introduced Pre-Priming which allows each data manipulation command like load, insert etc 
to fire a request to the index server to load the corresponding segments into the index server.
When index server receives a request it checks whether the request is for pre-priming, if it is then the request is 
processed in a new thread, and a dummy response is immediately returned to the client.
Since pre-priming acts as an async call, it does not have any negative performance impacts. 

The user can enable prepriming by using 'carbon.indexserver.enable.prepriming' = 'true/false'. By default this is set as false.

## FAQ

Q. **Index Server is throwing Large response size exception.** 

A. The exception would show the size of response it is trying to send over the
network. Use ipc.maximum.response.length to a value bigger than the
response size.

Q. **Unable to connect to index server**

A. Check whether the carbon.properties configurations are set in JDBCServer as well as the index
server.

Q. **IndexServer is throwing FileNotFoundException for index files.**

A. Check whether the Index server and JDBCServer are connected to the
same namenode or not. And the store should be shared by both

Q. **OutOfMemoryException in DirectMemoryBuffer**

A. Increase -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize in driver.extraJavaOptions to
accommodate the large response in driver.
