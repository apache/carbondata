/**
 *  Factory for {@link FineGrainIndex}
 *
 *  1. Any filter query which hits the table with index will call prune method of FGindex.
 *  2. The prune method of FGindex return list FineGrainBlocklet , these blocklets contain the
 *     information of block, blocklet, page and rowids information as well.
 *  3. The pruned blocklets are internally wriitten to file and returns only the block ,
 *    blocklet and filepath information as part of Splits.
 *  4. Based on the splits scanrdd schedule the tasks.
 *  5. In filterscanner we check the indexwriterpath from split and reNoteads the
 *     bitset if exists. And pass this bitset as input to it.
